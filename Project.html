    <h1>Cost of Living: UK Analysis and Social Effects</h1>
    <h4>Aim</h4>
    <h2>The aim of the project is to examine how the change in cost of living across the UK is affecting the population
        at the social level. When referring to the “social level”, we consider our main KPIs to be: <h2>
            <h2> 1) Life satisfaction index 2) Happiness index 3) Racial inequalities.</h2>
            <h2>We will first aim to establish how the cost of living has changed over the years 2020, 2021 and 2022,
                whilst
                also examining the real growth rate of earnings (i.e. after adjusting for inflation). We will then be
                looking at
                data related to our three main KPIs to establish whether these have changed over the past 3 years.
                Our initial assumption is that the cost of living is rising, mainly due to the recent pandemic
                disrupting supply
                chains, as well as the recent Russian-Ukrainian conflict causing a spike in energy costs. We would
                therefore
                expect a negative impact across the above 3 KPIs, given that people who are struggling to afford basic
                necessities such as housing, food, and healthcare are more likely to experience mental health issues.
                Additionally, we would expect certain income/racial groups to be disproportionately affected compared to
                others.</h2>

                    <h4>Data Use and Access </h4>
                    <h2>The data used for the specific project have been obtained from the UK ONS website; this implies
                        that our data source is both public and reliable. After the relevant csv files were obtained
                        from the website, they were manually cleaned in excel and imported into Vega Lite for the
                        purpose of creating visualizations. In terms of the manual cleaning in excel, I would generally
                        manipulate the original file so that I am left with two columns, the first one outlining the
                        name of the variable, and the second one outlining the value of the variable.
                        Various examples found on the “Rapid Charts” website were used as inspiration when creating my
                        visualizations. The segmented UK map, as seen in Fig. 5 and 6, was created using the geojson.io
                        tool. It should be noted that, even though automation is not a key feature of my project, all
                        data sources/tools used are publicly available and the manual cleaning process is straight
                        forward, so in that sense, the process/results should be very easy to replicate.
                        All data sources/tools are properly referenced in the “Appendix” section.

                    </h2>
                    <h4>Challenges faced and tools used</h4>
                    <h2>No major challenges were faced in relation to data cleaning, as this was manually done in excel
                        and the manipulation of data was generally a linear process. In terms of the data analysis, the
                        main challenge I faced revolved around using appropriate visualizations to illustrate my data.
                        In some instances, a stacked bar chart was the most appropriate visual to use, whereas in other
                        cases, more complex visuals (i.e. the segmented UK map chart) were a better choice. Often times,
                        I had to visualize the same dataset using different charts in order to establish which version
                        is the most easily digestible. Moreover, in certain instances, finding data across different
                        years was not feasible, thus making comparisons/drawing conclusions more challenging.</h2>
                    <h4> Conclusion </h4>
                    <h2>With reference to Fig.1, the CPIH rate increased across all categories between years 2020 –
                        2022, signifying that the cost of living is increasing at an increasing rate, with house prices
                        also experiencing a significant increase (Fig.3). This could be forcing a large portion of the
                        population to rent, with renters spending a staggering 50% of monthly income on rent & utilities
                        (Fig.2), whilst at the same time experiencing a drop in real earnings (-2.7%) as per Fig. 4.
                        The above illustrate that consumer spending power is decreasing, which we would associate with a
                        decrease in the Happiness and Life satisfaction indexes, as well as a major stress factor. Fig.7
                        illustrates that the rising cost of living represents a significant concern for 76% of the
                        population, highlighting the scale of the issue. However, looking at Fig 5 & 6, we can see a
                        general trend in the opposite direction; we believe this driven by the pandemic ending in 2022
                        and could worsen in the future. Finally, it seems that non-white people/ethnic minorities are
                        having a harder time paying rent and utility bills compared to their white counterparts (Fig.8);
                        this could suggest that racial inequality will increase within the coming years.
