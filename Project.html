    <h3>Data Science Project 2022</h3>
    <h1>Cost of Living: UK Analysis and Effects</h1>
    <h4>Aim:</h4>
    <h2>The project aims to examine the impact of the current Cost of Living in the UK on peoplesâ€™ Mental Health and
        highlight the importance of financial comfort and stability as a means of attending a reasonably good quality of
        life.
        The Cost of Living is becoming more and more of an important issue in the UK, with prices soaring at significant
        levels, due to the upwards racing of energy cost, which was primarily induced by the recent Russian-Ukrainian
        conflict.
        <h2>Studies have shown that people who are struggling to afford basic necessities such as housing, food, and
            healthcare are more likely to experience mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress. This
            can
            be especially true for those who are already living with mental health conditions, as the added financial
            pressures can exacerbate their symptoms.</h2>

                    <h4>Data Use and Access </h4>
                    <h2>For this project, I used publicly available data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
                        website to create the charts shown below. I downloaded the relevant CSV file, cleaned the data,
                        and then used Vega Lite and Rapid Charts examples as inspiration for creating the charts. For
                        the maps, I used geojson.io. These tools and resources can be used to replicate my process.
                    </h2>

                    <h4> Conclusion </h4>
                    <h2>Figures 1 and 2 reveal that prices have not only increased in the housing market, but also in
                        other essential categories like food, transport, and healthcare, according to the consumer price
                        index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH). The effects of these price increases are
                        noticeable among all households, but particularly among those that rent instead of owning their
                        homes. Figure 3 illustrates that there are regional differences in the UK's housing market, with
                        house prices being highest in England compared to the rest of the country. Figures 4-7
                        demonstrate the impact of the rising cost of living on mental health, as indicated by the
                        Happiness and Life Satisfaction Index. The data suggests that Northern Ireland has the highest
                        scores on both indices, while Scotland has the lowest. However, when asked about symptoms of
                        worry, 76% of the sample data indicated that they were "very worried" or "somewhat worried."
                        Finally, the rising cost of living is a contributing factor to mild or even severe depression.
